# Caesium
Caesium is a simple command-line utility for time management.


## Installation
You'll have to figure it out yourself and build from source.
Sorry.
Before you can compile it with `make`, I have to be able to compile it manually.


## Usage
```
$ ./caesium
```


## Roadmap

### Early development
- Tasks module `tasks.c` and `tasks.h` usable by end of April
- Blocks module `blocks.c` and `blocks.h` usable by end of April
- Able to build with `make` by end of April

### Alpha
- Able to match tasks to free (non-blocked) time by end of May
- Task priorities by end of May

### Beta
- Simplistic auto-scheduling by end of Q3 2023

### Production
- Complete auto-scheduling by end of Q4 2023


## Licensing
Caesium is [unlicensed](https://unlicense.org/) and is therefore in the
worldwide public domain, meaning that you can do almost anything with the
source code without asking my permission.

Instead of forcibly imposing a bunch of restrictive legalese on you, I'd like to
request in a non-binding way that you give back by releasing your modifications
to Caesium (if you choose to make any) into the public domain.


## FAQ

### Why isn't there a graphical interface?
Because Caesium is currently in a very early development stage.

### Why is it called Caesium?
I like naming my softwares after elements, and caesium the element is used in
atomic clocks.
